# Examples notebooks

This folder contains a few demo notebooks that demonstrates how to use the framework in various scenarios.

Each notebook is self-contained and can be run independently, and includes a brief description of the scenario or feature.

## Configuration

A `.env` file is required to run the notebooks. You can copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and update the values.

**NOTE**: The `.env` file is not included in the Git repository for security reasons (it is listed in `.gitignore`).
