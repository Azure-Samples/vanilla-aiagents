    "# Real-world example: TelCo Call Center\n",
    "\n",
    "This large notebook demonstrates how to apply this framework for build a real-world example: a call center for a telecommunications company. The core idea is to support users in their requests, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Technical support**: users can call to ask for help with their internet connection, devices, or mobile.\n",
    "- **Sales**: users can call to ask for new services, plans, or promotions.\n",
    "- **Legal**: users can call to ask for information about their contracts, bills, or legal rights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: an Azure AI Search instance is required to run the \"Legal\" agent, which performs RAG. A basic setup via [\"Import and vectorize your data\"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-get-started-portal-import-vectors?tabs=sample-data-storage%2Cmodel-aoai%2Cconnect-data-storage) and a sample guidelines file is enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to skip this setup, either comment our the \"Legal\" agent or use the `telco_callcenter_sequence` notebook instead.\n"
